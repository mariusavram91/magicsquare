# Magic Squares

This script:

## Allows the user to enter N through standard input, where N is any positive odd integer.
## Checks that N is valid and prompt the user to enter another value for N if it is not.
## Calculates a valid magic square for that value of N.
## Prints out the magic square, legibly.
## Verifies that the magic square is indeed valid.
## Prints “Correct!” if the verification step passes.
