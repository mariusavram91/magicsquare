# Magic Squares

Script that builds Magic Squares with dimension n*n, where n is an odd positive
integer.

A magic square is a square grid of distinct numbers such that each row and
column add up to the same number. Further, the two diagonals (from corner to
corner) also add up to that number.

This script:

- Allows the user to enter N through standard input, where N is any positive odd integer.
- Checks that N is valid and prompt the user to enter another value for N if it is not.
- Calculates a valid magic square for that value of N.
- Prints out the magic square, legibly.
- Verifies that the magic square is indeed valid.
- Prints “Correct!” if the verification step passes.
- * Also runs the tests for some of the functions

## Environment

If you don't have Python you can follow the instructions from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Make sure to install Python 3.x

First, create an environment.
```
$ virtualenv env
```
If you have both python 2.x and 3.x versions, use the below command.
```
$ virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3 env
```
You can activate it.
```
$ source ./env/bin/activate
```
Verify the version of python with the below command.
```
$ python
Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 23 2017, 16:37:01)
[GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
When not using you can deactivate it.
```
$ deactivate
```

## Run the script

Python 3 is a requirement.

```
$ python magicsquare.py
```

Behold the magic!

You should get an output similar to this:
```

Please enter any positive odd integer: 3

Magic square is (dimension n=3):
7       3       2
5       1       6
9       8       4
Correct!
